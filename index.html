	 														Fake Currency Note Identification Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
	 													</h3>
	 													<div class="">
															Under the mentorship of Dr. S.K. Pal at <b>DRDO</b>(Defence Research & Development Organization of India), New Delhi, we examined the feasibility of learning security features of the new Indian currency notes using a Deep Learning model. Created synthetic datasets of real and fake currency note images of ₹2000, ₹500 (~1600, ~7000 images respectively). Used a VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network model pre-trained on ImageNet (~14 million images), and fine-tuned it with our small datasets. The model could classify images in test sets with 100% and 67% accuracy respectively. The observations were reported to the SmartTech-2017 conference.<br>

And if at the INITIAL stage, if control is compromised in pursuit of the 'easy', then it can be scary. Humans will be the new ants.

 												<div class="jumbotron">
	 												My current research interest lies in studying Convolutional Neural Network Architectures. The question : "Is the selected CNN optimal for the dataset in terms of accuracy and model size?" is of great importance in deep learning research in the present time. I am working under the mentorhship of Dr. S.K. Pal (DRDO, New Delhi), with this question as our research focus. Here is some interesting and encouraging research in this area:

	 												<div class="container" style="padding: 10px">
	 												<ul>
														
                                                        <li><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.08362.pdf'>PerforatedCNNs</a>: In this paper, they used the idea of Code Perforation, a source code optimization strategy. The idea in code perforation is to simply skip every other step in the loop, or every two steps, or whatever the program can get away with skipping without sacrificing too much accuracy. So, for the deep learning problem, they find indices in the image matrix for which convolutions will be applied, and for the rest of the indices, the nearest neighbor value(with exact output calculated using convolution) will be used. They call these set of indices with exact output "perforation masks". Through their experiments CNNs like AlexNet and VGG-16 could be accelerated by 2x to 4x with a small decrease in accuracy using perforation.</li><br>

														<li><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07326v3.pdf'>DropNeuron</a>: In this paper, they improvised on the Regularization part. Instead of regularizing each single weight separately in all the layers, they applied a grouping effect on incoming and outgoing weights of a neuron during regularisation to drop the neuron completely from the network. This could achieve a compression rate of above 60% in case of their CNN experiment !</li><br>

														<li><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.00299.pdf'>Dynamic DNNs</a>: They have done some really interesting work in the research. They combined the conventional back-propagation with reinforcement learning to train a 'control' module which, depending on the input can choose to skip some part of the network and thus save the computation for that part. Their focus was to optimize accuracy-efficiency cut-offs and through a number of experiments they proved that their Dynamic DNN could achieve it. They implemented it with a well-known library Torch. Moreover, this DDNN is deterministic, in contrast to the other stochastic approached they reference in the paper which have been tried along this line of research.</li><br>

														<li><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07043v3.pdf'>CNNVis</a>: They created a visual analytics system to help researchers in diagnosing and refining CNNs by offline analysing 'snapsots' of a CNN cuptured during training. Advanced algorithms - rectangle packing, matrix reordering, edge bundling, biclustering were used.</li><br>

														<li><a href='https://vision.cornell.edu/se3/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/boosted-convolutional-neural-1.pdf'>BoostCNN</a>: In this paper, they used the boosting concept where several weak-learners result in a strong learner. They experimented with CNNs with 8 different input size variations as the weak learners. In future work, they say that they plan to apply BoostCNN to general large scale classification datasets and include a more diverse set of networks with different depths and configurations to find the best structure. This research requires very heavy computing resources however.</li><br>
